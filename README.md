## Project

> 1. User registration, login, logout

- Users can sign up by entering their email, name, username, and password.
- When signing up, the entered password is hashed using Bcrypt, and the account information is stored in PostgreSQL.
- Users can log in by entering their username and password.
- Upon successful login, a JsonWebToken is received and stored in the local storage.
- Update local state using Apollo Client and Reactive variables.
- Updating Reactive variables triggers the update of all queries depending on that variable.
- When logging out, change the Reactive variables, remove the stored token in local storage, and delete the stored data in the store.

> 3. Follow and unfollow users

- Users can follow or unfollow other users.
- When following or unfollowing, the Apollo Client directly modifies the cached field values of both users to update the follower and following lists.
- Once you follow a user, you can see their uploaded photos on the home page. <br /><br /> <img height="700" src="./previews/4.gif" />
- Search users and hashtags
- Search for users with @username (ex: @nasa)
- Search hashtags with #hashtag (ex: #space)
- Using React Hook Form, search for users with @name and hashtags with #hashtag.

  <img height="700" src="./previews/9.gif" />

> 9. Follow update

- With GraphQL Subscriptions, users can receive follow updates in real-time when someone follows them.
- Using PubSub, following an event is published, and the user listening to that event receives a follow update notification.
  <br /><br />
  <img height="700" src="./previews/10.gif" />

> 10. Dark mode

- Click on the sun or moon to switch between light and dark modes.
